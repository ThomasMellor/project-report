\section{Data Generation}

The evolution of the condensate phase was simulated using code written in C++. This defined the codensate as a square lattice consisting of $N^2$ points, where $N$ is the linear size of the lattice, and each point restricted to be between $[0, 2 \pi]$. Initially, the angle of each point was random, the system therefore being in the disordered phase. The simulation updated each lattice point according to the compactified and discretised equation:
\[
\begin{split}
\theta_{i,j}(t +\dd{t}) = \theta_{i,j}(t) +  \dd{t}[&- D_x ( \cos(\theta_{i,j} - \theta_{i+1,j}) + \cos( \theta_{i,j} - \theta_{i-1,j}) - 2)\\
 					&- D_y(\cos(\theta_{i,j} - \theta_{i,j-1}) + \cos(\theta_{i,j} - \theta_{i,j+1}) - 2) \\
					& -\frac{\lambda_x}{2}(\sin(\theta_{i,j} - \theta_{i+1,j}) + \sin( \theta_{i,j} - \theta_{i-1,j}) ) \\ 
					& -\frac{\lambda_y}{2}(\sin(\theta_{i,j} - \theta_{i,j-1}) + \sin(\theta_{i,j} - \theta_{i,j+1}))] \\
					& +2\pi c_L \times \sqrt{\dd{t}} \times \xi 
\end{split}
\]
where $\theta_{i,j}(t)$ is the value of the condensate at points $i,j$ of the lattice and $\dd{t}$ is the timestep used. Periodic boundary conditions were used. The final term is the stochastic term where $\xi$ is a uniformaly distributed random number (restricted to $[-0.5, 0.5]$) that was also added at each timestep. 

The timestep was initially chosen to be $\dd{t}=0.01$ and this was the value used to generate the significant data. However, other values were considered with: namely, $\dd{t} = 0.02$ and $\dd{t} = 0.001$ with system size 32. \fig{\ref{fig:binder_different_cL}} comes the Binder cumulant for this system size for the three values of $\dd{t}$. The evolution for $\dd{t}=0.02$  did not follow that of $\dd{t}=0.01$, implying that $\dd{t}=0.02$ was potentially too large of a timestep, whereas the behaviour of $\dd{t}=0.01$ reasonably matched that of $\dd{t}=0.001$, demonstrating that $\dd{t}=0.01$ was an appropriate timestep for the simulation, and a smaller one was computationally unnecessary.

The convergence of $\dd{t}=0.001$ compared to $\dd{t}=0.01$ suggests that a timestep of $\dd{t}=0.001$ was unnecessary, while the behaviour of $\dd{t}=0.02$ although qualitatively correct, deviated from that $\dd{t}=0.02$ significantly to be considered trustworthy.}

The value of $c_L$ at which the phase transition occurs was determined. \fig{\ref{fig:vor_vs_cL}} shows the number of vortices $t=400$ for a system size of 64 at various values of $c_L$. The value $c_L = 0.2$ was then chosen for the remainder of project. Naively, after determining that $c_L=0.2$ resulted in the Binder cumulant evolving from zero to near one in the linear evolution, $c_L=0.1$ was also tested with the expectation that the convergence would occur faster. In fact, for $L=128$, the Binder cumulant did not approach one at all, as shown in \fig{\ref{fig:binder_cL_0.1}}. This can be explained by the existence of vortices, which are higher in \fig{\ref{fig:vor_vs_cL}} for $c_L=0.1$ than higher values below the transition.

\section{Data Extraction}

Using the generated data, the Binder cumulant was calculated as follows: for each timestep of a simulation, the magnetisation $\myvec{M}$, defined by 
\[
\myvec{M} = \frac{1}{N^2}\sum_{i,j} (\cos( \theta_{i,j}), \sin ( \theta_{i,j})),
\]
 where the sum is over all lattice points, was calculated. The averages (over all the realisations) $ \left < \myvec{M}^2 \right >$ and $\left < {(\myvec{M}^2)}^2 \right> $ were then used in the Binder cumulant given by 
\[
g = 2 - \frac{\left < (\myvec{M}^2)^2 \right >}{\left < \myvec{M}^2 \right>^2}    
\]

To estimate the error, the Binder cumulant was considered to be a function of the variables $ \myvec{M}^2 >$, i.e.
\[
g = 2 - N \frac{\sum_i (\myvec{M}^2_i)^2}{\left ( \sum_i \myvec{M}^2_i\right)^2}
\]
where the sum is over every realisation and $N$ is the number of realisations. These variables are indentical and independent, so the error of each is the same and is approximated by 
\[
\sigma^2_{\myvec{M}^2} = \frac{1}{N-1} \sum_i (\myvec{M}^2_i - \left < \myvec{M}^2 \right>)^2 = \frac{N}{N-1} (\left< (\myvec{M}^2)^2 \right > - \left < \myvec{M}^2\right>^2).
\] 
Using error propagation, the error on the Binder cumulant is 
\[
\begin{split}
\sigma_g^2 &= 4N^2 \sum_k \left( \frac{\myvec{M}^2_k}{\left ( -\sum_i \myvec{M}^2_i  \right )^2} + \frac{\sum_i (\myvec{M}^2_i)^2}{\left(\sum_i \myvec{M}^2_i \right)^3} \right)^2 \sigma_{\myvec{M}^2} \\
	   &= \frac{4N^3}{N-1}\left(\left <(\myvec{M}^2)^2 \right >   - \left<\myvec{M}^2\right>^2 \right) \sum_k
\end{split}
\]
